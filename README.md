With this application user can insert a .csv file containing GPS data for a vehicle, and view the path on the map and also trip details like speed, duration, distance and so on.
<br/>
The app is developed using `React.js` and `Chakra UI` for Front-end, `Node.js` and `Express.js` for Backend, and `MongoDB` as Database.

## Please Note (Important) :

- Use email: `user1@example.com` and Password: `User@001`. The credentials are hardcoded for a single user.
- The backend is hosted on a free service, so there might be a delay while opening the site for the first time. Please wait for it to load.
